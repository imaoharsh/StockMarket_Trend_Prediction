# StockMarket_Trend_Prediction
Predicting stock market trends is a complex yet crucial task for investors and traders. This repository houses a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock market movements.


🔍 Key Features:
Time Series Data: Utilizes historical stock market data, including opening/closing prices, high/low values, and trading volumes.
LSTM Architecture: Employs a sequential model with multiple LSTM layers to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the data.
Dropout Layers: Incorporates dropout layers to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.

🚀 How to Use:
Data Preparation: Organize historical data into sequences to form input-output pairs for training.
LSTM Training: Train the LSTM model on historical data, allowing it to learn patterns and trends.
Prediction: Utilize the trained model to predict future stock market trends.

📊 Evaluation:
Measures model performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Validates predictions against actual market trends.

🛠️ Customization:
Adjustable hyperparameters for fine-tuning based on specific datasets.
Explore different LSTM configurations to optimize predictive capabilities.

📜 Dependencies:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas
